# Unaccounted For Co-Worker

> Help! My co-worker hasn't showed up to work for the past week and my boss wants me to find out where he went. I know that he took an American Airlines flight from the "Mile High City" to the city with the largest historic theatre district on February 24th. A couple days later, I heard he took a train northwest 8 stops. Can you tell me the aircraft type and the final destination city?

Mile High City --> Denver, Colarado 

city with the largest historic theatre district --> Los Angeles, California

There is only one [AA flight on the 24th from Denver to LAX](https://flightaware.com/live/flight/AAL1164/history/20220224/2343Z/KDEN/KLAX).

From Los Angeles, [Coast Starlight](https://www.amtrak.com/coast-starlight-train) is the only train service that runs northwest.

<!-- The flag is `UMDCTF{A319_San_Jose}`. -->
